        <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p>
          I am AZEEZ MUHAMMED by name, happily married with two kids. <br />
          I am currently the CEO ARIS TRAVELS founded in 2021. <br />
          I love exploring the internet and search for relevant informations
          that could improve my knowledge of technology. <br />
          I had HND in CHEMISTRY/BIOCHEMISTRY and I had a great interest in
          Chemistry while in school and after school, but I lost interest in
          studying after years of job search and could not get a white collar
          job.
          <br />
          I was introduced to a travel agent in 2015 by my uncle where I was
          hired as a secretary and earning 12k monthly, I worked until 2020 when
          the CORONA VIRUS pandemic distrupted everything, I started my own
          travel company in 2021 till date. <br />
          My passion for technology lead me into wanting to become diversify and
          the fear of future occurence of pandemic so that I can have something
          doing as a remote worker to cater for my family needs.

        <h4>MY GOALS FOR SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING PROGRAMMES</h4>
        <p>
          Having passion for techonology and innovation was the first thing that
          made me to go for the school of engineering programmes. <br />
          But as a person that needs to become diversified economically, I want
          to venture into something that will continually be relevant no matter
          the economic situation of the world at large.
